<h1>MSST-v3 Summary</h1>
<p>
Product name: MSST-v3 (Modular, Sustainable, Short-range Transport)

The idea is a lower-cost electric scooter that is easily modifiable in order to add other things like a rear carriage or a bike or a larger motor, battery. Etc. while still being easy to use and provide a low{er} cost, high{er} lifespan device than other high-profit-margin options on the market. 
I’m just one person, obviously, but I’m working on adding more things to the unit and bringing the theoretical price down without reducing the device’s quality or lifespan.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>42 amp IP67 connectors and motor/controller 24 volts nominal
</p>
450W  16mph standard constant full duty top speed 20mph max with AccelBoost-32 tech. 

<p>Peak acceleration from zero to 10 mph is 1.7 seconds. </p>
<p>From zero to 20mph during AccelBoost (550W) battery capacity sector is 3.8 seconds. </p>
<p>15 miles with charge limit at 80%</p>
<p>18 miles with charge limit off</p>
<p>20 miles using Reserve</p> 
<p>Effective user cost for first production unit (due to sourcing): $27
Theoretical lowest cost for all parts: $450</p>
<p>Measurements taken on level asphalt road with mediocre pavement. 
Can handle most inclines.
</p>
<p>
(WARNING)
Long steep inclines where you notice excessive slowing are not advised to be driven on due to gravitational centering issues (safety concerns), and that this places excess strain on the motor which is detected by the HPDCR (Hi-Power Duty Cycle Regulator) and after an extended period of intense motor load (steep uphill climbing, throttle on while stuck), the HPDCR will deactivate the motor until throttle is removed and re-applied by the user. There is no other action needed.
(/WARNING)</p>
<p>The HPDCR has a Safety Overthrottle detection mode that allows the device to detect an overload (throttle is above threshold of voltage) and shut down with an Error Code on the Power LED (error 3) and deactivates the motor until system restart (as simple as flipping the power switch two times in succession.) 

The high-efficiency voltage conversion module allows precise and responsive input, while enabling an extended range due to low heat production and extremely efficient construction (as stated already.)

<h3>Battery features:</h3>
<p>600 watt charging allows 0% to 100% in 40 minutes 
Short circuit, temperature, overload, low-voltage, overcharge protection

LiFePO4 battery has a 15 to 20 year lifespan to 80% capacity and 30 years until replacement is absolutely due for the cell (although it will function mostly as normal, but with heavily reduced capacity.) 
(TIP)To extend the life of the battery, you can charge at a lower wattage such as 400W or 250W but this is not needed, and is only in the case you are paranoid or your circuit breaker has other high loads on it, in which case you can bring the charging speed down to 125W.(/TIP)

<p>120 Volt 60/50hz 600W inverter with X-BOOST technology enabling devices up to 1200W to run in reduced-voltage mode so they get the amperage they need to function. </p>Useful for small heaters, vacuum cleaners, car starters, large fridge-freezer combo units, etc. 
<p>Two grounded outlets, two polarised non-grounded outlets</p>
<p>Internal GFCI with auto-reset (inverter must be manually re-enabled by pressing the AC button or remote control in the app)</p>
<p>Internal two-stage circuit breaker (reset by enabling inverter also)</p>

USB-A x3 18W each (54W max on all USB-A ports)
USB-C 100W input/output

<p>12.5V (0.15V tolerance) car jack output port for 150W</p>
<p>12.5V (0.15V tolerance) separate DC5521 ports for 50W each (100W max total)</p>
[Note the voltage converter for the car jack output and DC5521 ports is the SAME but is rated for 300W and the wattage limitations are because of the port ratings.]

<p>- 220W Solar Input up to 50 volts</p>
<p>- 660W X-STREAM AC 120/240V input to fully  charge in under 1 hour</p>
<p>- AC passthrough up to 1500W with UPS function for power outages</p>
<p>- 0.1 second updating ARM-powered Smart BMS with voltage, temperature, and amperage monitoring, along with separate Input Output measurement and per-cell measurements</p>
<p>- ARM-powered 280mHz ESP32-S3-MINI-1 with WiFi (2.4G) and Bluetooth 5.1 support to connect to phone app </p>
<p>- Medium-size LCD segment display with battery wattage input/output, remaining percentage, remaining estimated time of use, wifi/bt status, fan status, error display, charging status</p>

<p>(TIP) The estimated time of use and percentage indicators on the battery do not reflect upon the MSST’s usage of the battery. The POWER LED on the MSST instead has three states: </p><p>GREEN-60 - 100%  </p>
<p>YELLOW-30 - 59%</p>
<p>RED-1 - 29% (/TIP)</p>
